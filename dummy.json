  {"id":"acemogluColonialOriginsComparative2001","abstract":"We exploit differences in European mortality rates to estimate the effect of institutions on economic performance. Europeans adopted very different colonization policies in different colonies, with different associated institutions. In places where Europeans faced high mortality rates, they could not settle and were more likely to set up extractive institutions. These institutions persisted to the present. Exploiting differences in European mortality rates as an instrument for current institutions, we estimate large effects of institutions on income per capita. Once the effect of institutions is controlled for, countries in Africa or those closer to the equator do not have lower incomes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Acemoglu","given":"Daron"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Robinson","given":"James A."}],"citation-key":"acemogluColonialOriginsComparative2001","container-title":"American Economic Review","DOI":"10.1257/aer.91.5.1369","ISSN":"0002-8282","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2001,12]]},"language":"en","page":"1369-1401","source":"www.aeaweb.org","title":"The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation","title-short":"The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.5.1369","volume":"91"},
  {"id":"adlerSocioLegalApproachAdministrative2003","abstract":"The first part of this article outlines two complementary approaches to enhancing administrative justice. Internal mechanisms, which can be put into place by government departments and public bodies themselves, are contrasted with external mechanisms, which result in the imposition on government departments and public bodies of principles enunciated by courts, tribunals, and ombudsmen. Lawyers are all too familiar with the external approach but tend to be much less familiar with the internal approach. The article seeks to redress this imbalance. It emphasizes the importance of the internal approach, not as an alternative but, rather, as a complement to the external approach and develops a framework for analyzing administrative justice in terms of “trade-offs” between different normative models of administrative decision-making. The second part of the article demonstrates how this approach to the study of administrative justice has informed research on the impact of computerization on social security in the United Kingdom; on decision making in the Scottish prison system; on the assessment of special educational needs in England and Scotland; and on the computerization of social security in thirteen countries. The article concludes by attempting to show that this approach to the study of administrative justice satisfies all the defining characteristics of the socio-legal paradigm.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Adler","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"adlerSocioLegalApproachAdministrative2003","container-title":"Law & Policy","DOI":"10.1111/j.0265-8240.2003.00153.x","ISSN":"1467-9930","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003]]},"language":"en","page":"323-352","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"A Socio-Legal Approach to Administrative Justice","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0265-8240.2003.00153.x","volume":"25"},

This Article offers an overview of the Bill of Rights illustrating how virtually all of its provisions relate to each other and to those of the original Constitution. The overview yields an unconventional finding: the dominant theme of the original Bill was not to vest individuals and minorities with substantive rights against popular majorities. Like the original Constitution, the Bill certainly focused on issues of federalism, bicameralism, representation, constitutional amendment, and popular sovereignty. The main thrust of the unReconstructed-that is pre-Fourteenth Amendment-Bill of Rights was far more structural and majoritarian than we have come to believe.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Amar","given":"Akhil Reed"}],"citation-key":"amarBillRightsConstitution1991a","container-title":"The Yale Law Journal","DOI":"10.2307/796690","ISSN":"0044-0094","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[1991]]},"page":"1131-1210","publisher":"The Yale Law Journal Company, Inc.","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Bill of Rights as a Constitution","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/796690","volume":"100"},

  {"id":"chandProtectingAgencyJudges2019","abstract":"Administrative judges, who serve in state and federal agencies, as opposed to a separate branch of government, are an understudied, and occasionally controversial, type of public administrator. Many who find themselves in administrative courts protest the agency judge’s lack of independence. According to critics, because agency judges are members of—and often evaluated by—the very agency with a vested interest in the case, they are subject to political influence and cannot possibly be an impartial arbitrator. In the United States, various approaches to addressing this concern have been employed. At the federal level, Congress grants some administrative judges statutory protections from agency evaluation. Most states have utilized an organizational independence approach by placing administrative judges in separate agencies dedicated to administrative adjudications. Via a national survey returned by 250 agency judges, this study compares perceptions of judicial independence and decisional confidence. It finds that administrative judges serving in independent agencies (known as central panels) report higher levels of judicial independence and more confidence their rulings will not be overturned. The theoretical implications are significant for public administration and administrative law scholars, especially those concerned about the politicization of administrative duties.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Chand","given":"Daniel E."}],"citation-key":"chandProtectingAgencyJudges2019","container-title":"The American Review of Public Administration","container-title-short":"The American Review of Public Administration","DOI":"10.1177/0275074019829608","ISSN":"0275-0740","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"395-410","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Protecting Agency Judges in an Age of Politicization: Evaluating Judicial Independence and Decisional Confidence in Administrative Adjudications","title-short":"Protecting Agency Judges in an Age of Politicization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0275074019829608","volume":"49"},

It is central to Hamburger’s argument that much of administrative law concerning both rulemaking and adjudication was “extralegal” and was thus regarded by English law during this period.

But what happens when we elect someone like Donald Trump to the office? How does that support the argument for a strong presidency? Shouldn't our response be to limit the office? In this book Moe and Howell say no. They open the book by talking about the reason for the rise of Trump and politicians in other countries who have taken advantage of populist dissatisfaction with the response of government to rising economic inequality, the devastation of communities by the loss of jobs due to globalization, the 2008 economic crisis, and increasing immigration. Howell and Moe contend that it is the weaknesses of democratic governments that have led to the election of the likes of Donald Trump. The remedy is to make governments more effective. And the only way to make governments more effective is to strengthen the executive, within strict parameters of law, to actually lead change. They offer their solution as a way to challenge Trump of whom they are critical in the book. They think effective government that can act to deal with the nation's broad social and economic problems is the only way to prevent the election of Trump or his ilk.

The phenomenon of slavery as an institution, the author argues, is a single process of recruitment, incorporation on the margin of society, and eventual manumission or death. --from publisher description","author":[{"family":"Patterson","given":"Orlando"}],"call-number":"HT871 .P37 2018","citation-key":"pattersonSlaverySocialDeath1982","event-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","ISBN":"978-0-674-98690-9","issued":{"date-parts":[[1982]]},"note":"OCLC: on1029804424","number-of-pages":"511","publisher":"Harvard University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Slavery and social death: a comparative study","title-short":"Slavery and social death","type":"book"},
