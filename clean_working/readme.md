in conjunction with my War on the Bluebook, I've made a prototype of a demonstration project proving that you can just embed machine-readable citation files directly into a PDF

This is a messy but working prototype version (ignore the fact that the name of the directory includes the word "clean" because it ain't.).  You can run it from a local server, like the one bundled with python. in conjunction with my War on the Bluebook, I've made a prototype of a demonstration project proving that you can just embed machine-readable citation files directly into a PDF.

This repo also contains two dependencies for this project, [Coherent PDF](https://github.com/coherentgraphics/coherentpdf.js/) and [a Base64 library by Dan Kogai](https://github.com/dankogai/js-base64).  The former is under the AGPL-3.0 license, and the latter is under the BSD 3-Clause license. Please see the above links for license details, source code, etc.
